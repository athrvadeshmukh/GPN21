# Scripts and Presentations from my Talks at GPN21 (in 2023) in Karlsruhe

## P4wnP1 A.L.O.A.

### DumpFakeHashes

To get the Hashes I used a fake hash generator because I do not want to show the real hashes stored at the system live. Basically, the fake hash generator is just a Python script with a few print commands. You can find both in this repository: The Python script and the Windows exwecutable.


### HIDScripts
In this section you can find all of my HID scripts from the demonstration at GPN21 except:

  - WIN-A02--DisableDefender.js
  - WIN-B01--PrivilegEscalation-Admin.js
  - WIN-D01--PrivilegEscalation-System.js
  - WIN-D03--Payload-DumpHashes.js
  - WIN-X99--ReactivateDefender.js

Even this are only key strokes they are potential dangerous.
